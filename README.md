Paint-by-Numbers is an application that lets user create, play and share [Nonogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram) puzzles. Nonograms are picture-logic puzzles where the players goal is to reveal all the **filled** tiles on the board while revealing as few **empty** tiles as possible.  

Nonograms can be created with ***any arrangement*** of filled and empty tiles on a grid, and are often designed to produce a simple image like Pixel art upon completion. On our application, Paint-by-Numbers, users are able to draw their own puzzles using an in-site interface or upload an image to be converted into a Puzzle. They are then able to share links to these puzzles with other users to try and solve, as well as create accounts to store libraries of puzzles they've created and save their progress on puzzles they're trying to solve.
